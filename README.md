# TheFourthDimension-Quality Of Life
A [**Super Mario 3d Land**](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_3D_Land) level editor, originally made by [Exelix11](https://github.com/exelix11).

This is a continuation of Exelix' [project](https://github.com/exelix11/TheFourthDimension) trying to improve it as much as possible.

## Usage
Extract your Super Mario 3d Land romfs folder using citra or godmode9 and load it following the program's steps, then open your level and edit as you like!

## Features
- Edits every 3d Land level and every file under romfs/StageData/
- 3d Previews of most assets
- byml <-> xml 
# New features
- Improvements to the general user experience:
  - Improved object database system with better args
  - Improved controls and render view
  - Redesigned UI
  - Vastly improved Parent-Child editing
  - Vastly improved Rail editing
  - Added hotkeys for the most important features
  - Recently open files option
  - Option to save some special files like CCNT to a LayeredFS folder
- New:
  - Fog editor
  - Camera editor
  - Object database editor
  - Worldmap editor (experimental)
- Major improvement to rails, cameras and group editing
- Cutscene objects now display the model they'll use ingame

## Roadmap (as of v1.0.0)
- [ ] Make the object list a treeview like other editors, this will be the best option to display all the object types and easily edit them
- [ ] Show/hide Rails
- [ ] Better renderer

## Building

Use Visual Studio (not Code) with the .NET framework (specifically 4.5.2).
It should load fine so just select `The4Dimension.sln` and then build.
